do i need to close out all the db sessions?

db changes:
add location to the event


misc:

fix url in event card not being clickable

consider making email optional

add an icon to show that you left feedback for a presentation

clean up unused html

there is a bug in updating the presentation lists that drops a presentation

consider making a get_user_or_fail function for "protected" routes
