do i need to close out all the db sessions?

db changes:



dev ops:

switch webserver to production not test

how do i auto restart the service?

how do i monitor the traffic?

how do i autoscale?

misc:


make the landing page make more sense

fix url in event card not being clickable

consider making email optional

filter out old event from dashboard

consider making a get_user_or_fail function for "protected" routes

make an event pannel that shows the submitted feedback so far
