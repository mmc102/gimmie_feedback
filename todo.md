do i need to close out all the db sessions?

db changes:



dev ops:

switch webserver to production not test

how do i auto restart the service?

how do i monitor the traffic?

how do i autoscale?

misc:

add meme to the landing page

fix url in event card not being clickable

consider making email optional

consider making a get_user_or_fail function for "protected" routes

make an event pannel that shows the submitted feedback so far

do people need access to the event page after the event? 
probably not, just send them a report

add a logo
