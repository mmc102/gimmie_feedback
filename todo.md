do i need to close out all the db sessions?

db changes:
add location to the event
add event_id to the user table so users are tied to the event
consider adding a user_id to the event so that the logged in user can edit the event

app flow:

make sure people can get to the reviews page from the event

misc:
fix some of the redirect logic
