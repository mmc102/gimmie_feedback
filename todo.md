do i need to close out all the db sessions?

db changes:



dev ops:

switch webserver to production not test

how do i auto restart the service?

how do i monitor the traffic?

how do i autoscale?

make a meaningful secret token from an env var

misc:

put datetime objects in the db not these crazy ass strings

add meme to the landing page

fix url in event card not being clickable

make an event pannel that shows the submitted feedback so far

do people need access to the event page after the event?
probably not, just send them a report

add a logo
