This is a simple web app collect feedback on events

As an event host you can make a series of "Presentations", each of which an audience member can leave feedback on.

The goal is to improve the feedback cycle on live events, and make it a bit easier for presenters and audience members to network after the event.

The long term goals of this project are for me to get better at deploying and managing a full stack app, build something that _someone_ will use, and learn to suck less at design and UI work.

Feel free to open issues or put up PR's if you want. I'd be open to feature requests if there is something you would use it for that is not currently supported.


If you are interested in self hosting you can see `DEPLOY.md` which may provide some helpful (chaos) for running the app on AWS. Feel free to reach out if you can't make sense of something.
